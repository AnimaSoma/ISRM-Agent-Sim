# Interactionist Self-Regulation Model (ISRM)

**A coherence-driven framework for modeling adaptation across physical, biological, and cognitive systems.**

This repository accompanies the preprint:  
**"The Interactionist Self-Regulation Model (ISRM): A Coherence-Driven Theory of Adaptation from Cells to the Cosmos"**  
by John Paul Schell

## ðŸ“– Overview

The ISRM framework proposes that adaptive systems regulate behavior and internal state updates by modulating a scalar function \( U(t) \), which integrates coherence, energy availability, and prediction error. This repository includes:

- Core Python modules implementing the ISRM logic
- Simulation data from 13 agent architectures
- Heatmaps and plots illustrating key dynamics (energy, subjective time, coherence)
- A plugin-based system for modular agent behavior

## ðŸ”§ Features

- Modular ISRM agent architecture (`ISRMManager`, `SensorySubsystem`, `MotivationalEngine`, etc.)
- Simulation of time perception, coherence dynamics, and decision-making under energy constraints
- Visualization tools (heatmaps, subjective time accumulation)
- Plugin API for extending agent behavior

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ISRM_Framework.git
cd ISRM_Framework
